# CS6730-Project
###Georgia Tech CS6730: Simulation and Modeling
```Project 1: Road Traffic Simulation (C++) 
> 1.  Derived simulation model based on traffic data and geographic data of the area
> 2.  Implemented discrete event simulation engine based on derived model ,simulated road traffic and validated it with real data
> 3.  Proposed unsynchronized traffic light timing strategy for the optimization of traffic flow based on the simulation result
```Project 2: Network Topology Simulation(C++)
